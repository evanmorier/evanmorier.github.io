# Some "political numbers"

Commonly seen in US media/politics:

- Poll numbers, polling aggregations, election winner forecasts

In other areas and academic research, there are many many more!

- How does education level affect voter turnout?
- Do voters punish corrupt politicians in subsequent elections?
- Are legislators more likely to respond to letters from constituents of the same race?
- Do countries with more poor people receive more foreign aid?

## How to do well in this class (1)

I am committed to your success! Here are ways you can help yourself:

- Read all assigned readings
- Work with R immediately, use it often (e.g. try code from lecture on your own computer)
- Take notes, esp. what *isn't* on slides
- Work with others on problem sets (turn in own work)
- Review all solutions, compare them to your own answers
- Complete all assignments, including learning checks for lecture videos

Do not fall behind in this course, as it is very difficult to catch up

## How to do well in this class (2)

Here are ways you can get help from us (but only if we know you need help!):

- Post questions on the Canvas discussion forum
- Email me/your TA (Priyadarshi)
- Come to drop-in office hours or make an individual appointment



Remember: There is less contact time (lectures plus section) each week than in a typical 3 credit course

- Independent work, including reading and coding practice, is very important for succeeding in this course!

**Office hours**

- Office hours = student hours!
- Time we set aside to help students, answer questions, etc.
- All students are welcome and encouraged to attend office hours
    + Plan on attending my (or Priyadarshi's) office hours *at least once* this semester
- Drop-in office hours best for section/problem set assignments  
  - I will only have drop-in hours during problem set weeks


**Sign up for individual meetings **

- Best for help with your project (but can be used for general help as well)

Download and install R and RStudio (instructions on Canvas)

**Next week**:

Lecture materials will be posted on Sunday night/Monday morning

Section materials will generally be posted each Tuesday
